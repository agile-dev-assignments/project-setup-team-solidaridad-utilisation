# Guide to Contributing
## How Disagreements or Conflicts Should Be Resolved
- Transparency between contributors to prevent conflicts & misunderstandings as much as possible.
- If there is conflicting work, see how to split the ticket even more so that it doesn’t interfere with each other.
- When dealing with concerns and issues with the way the project is currently going, feel free to say it on Slack along with an objective reason why it will not work.
- All other team members can either react or start a thread off of that comment and we can decide from there.
- If we can’t decide something by ourselves, the scrum master should go to the Professor for more insight.
