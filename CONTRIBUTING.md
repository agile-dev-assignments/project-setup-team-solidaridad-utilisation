# Guide to Contributing

## Rules of Contributing
- Every pull request should be related to an assigned task or bug
- Always do pull requests instead of merging directly

## Project Values / Team Norms
- Come to the meetings on time 
    - Discuss meaningful content
    - 1 hour cap on team discussion meetings
- Support those who are learning 
- Standups (3 days/week)
- Post link to meeting in general chat
    - Take notes for each meeting and post after it's done in Slack
- Transparency
    - As soon as a problem arises, report in Slack
- No shame in having a problem, we are here to help each other out

## Git Workflow
1. Commit your changes locally
2. Before pushing and making a pull request to the main branch, pull all of the recent changes to your branch so that you deal with merge conflicts on the local end instead of GitHub
3. Pull requests should contain a description indicating the task or issue it solves

## How Disagreements or Conflicts Should Be Resolved
- Transparency between contributors to prevent conflicts & misunderstandings as much as possible.
- If there is conflicting work, see how to split the ticket even more so that it doesn’t interfere with each other.
- When dealing with concerns and issues with the way the project is currently going, feel free to say it on Slack along with an objective reason why it will not work.
- All other team members can either react or start a thread off of that comment and we can decide from there.
- If we can’t decide something by ourselves, the scrum master should go to the Professor for more insight.
